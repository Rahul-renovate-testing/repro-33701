The goal of this repo is to test a Github Action. The Github Action's job is to create and maintain an issue which aontains the list of all the issues in this reposirotu which do not have a label attached to them.

Incase, all isues have labels do not create a new issue.
Incase, an issue exists, then do not close it when no issues are present with 0 labels..just update the issue description to mention that no issues need labels added to them.
Keep the issue up-to-date.
